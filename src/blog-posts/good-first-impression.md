# Hello World

**A good first impression with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

This is my homepage, where I hope to attract people who might be interested in hiring me. I want them to be able to pop open their browser consoles and immediately be greeted by pleasantly readable source code. I don't want them to be greeted by code using some framework they're unfamiliar with, or with code that's been bundled and transpiled into an unintelligible mass. So I'm keeping things nice and simple.
