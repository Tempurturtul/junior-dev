# Hello World

**A good first impression with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

*Updated: June 21, 2016*

If you haven't noticed yet, this entire site is built with plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There's no third-party framework in use. No transpilation from ES6 JavaScript to ES5, nor from SCSS to CSS. No bundling with Browserify or Webpack. The resources aren't even minified (aside from the images).

Why? Well this is my homepage, where I hope to attract people who might be interested in hiring me. I want them to be able to pop open their browser consoles and immediately be greeted by pleasantly readable source code. I don't want them to be greeted by code using some framework they're unfamiliar with, or with code that's been bundled and transpiled into an unintelligible mass. So I'm trying to keep things nice and simple.

I'm also making an effort to avoid third-party libraries in favor of rolling my own code. Normally this would be foolish (it might even turn out to be foolish here), since my code definitely has a greater likelihood of failure than library code that's been tested and worked on by a multitude of very talented people. But by rolling my own code I hope to offer valuable insight into my abilities as a developer.

So far I've established my own basic Model-View-Controller pattern and built in some simple hash-based routing. I have further plans to establish methods for converting these blog posts to semantic HTML, and for applying dates and topic tags to them. Hopefully I'll have succeeded in those efforts by the time you read this.
