# A good first impression with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is my home site, where I hope to attract people who might be interested in hiring me. I want them to be able to pop open their browser consoles and immediately be greeted by pleasantly readable source code. I do not want them to be greeted by code using some framework they're unfamiliar with, or with code that's been bundled and transpiled into an unintelligible mass.

**Don't misunderstand,** I do love babel and browserify; and Sass and Autoprefixer; and the hundreds of frameworks and libraries available. I do normally concatenate and minify resources. But this is an exercise in simplicity. And I'm actually rather excited about it.
