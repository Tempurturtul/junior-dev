My name's Matt. In 2011 I graduated from a small college with a B.S. degree in Homeland Security Management. After entering the field it wasn't long before I began to feel like I'd made a mistake. I've loved working with computers since I was young, but I had always been afraid to base my career around them because I didn't want to risk corrupting my passion by making it my work.

During an intellectually unfulfilling first year in my new career, I finally took a serious stab at learning to program with Zed Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). I enjoyed the book immensely and enthusiastically began trying to apply what I'd learned. Like most fledgling programmers (I assume), I had a strong interest in creating games. I used Python in attempts to recreate simple arcade games for awhile before discovering the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game engine. I used Unity to learn Unity's variant of JavaScript, and then to learn C#.

I learned a lot while working through numerous Unity tutorials, and also dabbled briefly in web development by taking Bob Tabor's [HTML5 and CSS3 Fundamentals](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/HTML5-CSS3-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners) course. I later took Dan Grossman's [Programming Languages](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/13sp/) course, offered via the University of Washington and Coursera. During the course, Professor Grossman focused on teaching and comparing SML, Racket, and Ruby; SML and Racket being examples of statically and dynamically typed functional languages, and Ruby being an example of a dynamically typed object-oriented language. The course was perfectly challenging and introduced me to a variety of new concepts that stoked my interest in the field even further.

As my love for programming grew, my satisfaction with my current career plummeted. I researched software engineering careers for awhile and settled on web development as a possible field I could switch to in the near future.

I settled in and focused on learning web development. I worked through [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) front-end content, then completed a [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program from Udacity. (See my [review of the program](#/blog/reviewing-fend) if you're interested.)

In July of 2016 I applied and got accepted to [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/), a coding bootcamp focusing on web development with JavaScript. It looked like my goal of switching to a career in web development was nearing completion. Unfortunately, circumstances in my personal life changed during the month between application and acceptance, and I had to decline the offer to attend.

I'm now pursuing a second B.S. degree, this time in Computer Science from Oregon State University via their fully online [post-baccalaureate program](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/online-cs-students). I should be able to complete the program in two years, providing myself with more opportunities outside web development, and finally completing my transition to a career as a software engineer in early 2018. This is happily also around the time I'll be looking to relocate from my currently rural location.

In addition to pursuing the CS degree, I'm keeping busy with [learning Haskell](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/learning/tree/master/haskell) and with personal web development projects (like Junior Dev!) intended to help me retain and grow my existing knowledge.
