# Hello World

*Last modified: July 19, 2016*

Here I intend to write about things I learn and do while making the switch to a career in software development, specifically JavaScript-centric web development. Now as the site title indicates, I'm not an experienced developer and will undoubtedly provide bad information here and there. (Hopefully not everywhere!) If you notice some bad information, or something that's just really poorly explained, please please please tell me about it. You'll not only be helping me (a great deal), but you'll also be helping anyone who happens along after you.

...

If you're interested in my background and the things I've learned so far, have a look at the [About](#/about) page. You'll also find contact details there. I'm very open to questions, comments, and suggestions; please don't hesitate to get in touch.
