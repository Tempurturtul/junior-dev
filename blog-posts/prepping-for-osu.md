# Prepping for OSU

*Created: August 29, 2016*

[Oregon State University](http://oregonstate.edu) offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science that is specifically tailored for individuals who already possess a Bachelor's degree in another field. It can be completed in as little as one year or as long as four years, and is fully remote (online).

I'm planning to enroll for the winter term starting in January 2017, but first I need to satisfy the math prerequisite of college algebra or above. Most applicants will already have this prerequisite fulfilled, but unfortunately I don't.

I decided to satisfy the prereq by taking precalculus at my local community college, which thankfully offers it as an online course. I needed to take a placement test first to satisfy the prereq for *that* course, and to prep for the placement test I used the appendix from a precalculus textbook my math major partner happened to have available. I vaguely remembered most of the material from highschool, and after working through the appendix I managed to place high enough to get into the course.

I should finish the course in December, and be set to attend OSU's program in January.

I feel very good about this. I'll finally have a degree for the field I want to be in, and from a well-known, respectable school. The degree will also be, according to the program's [future students page](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/online-cs-students/future-students), identical to the one earned by on-campus students.
