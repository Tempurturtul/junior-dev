# Reviewing FEND

**Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.**

*Created: July 24, 2016*

This review was originally posted on Reddit's /r/learnprogramming and /r/webdev subreddits. The [/r/learnprogramming post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4m1t70/udacity_nanodegree_review_frontend_web_development/) attracted the attention of Cameron Pittman, creator of the majority of the nanodegree's content. Have a look if you're interested in further insight into the program.

I earned [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) certificate in May (2016) and thought I'd offer my thoughts on the program and share the projects I was required to complete.

If you just want to see what your finished projects might look like, [here's a link to mine on GitHub.](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects)

**Before reading on, you should be aware that I completed most of FreeCodeCamp's front-end content before enrolling in Udacity's program. This gave me a good introduction to the basics.**

## Time & Cost

The program cost **$200 a month** and took **6 months** for me to complete at a pace of maybe 15 hours a week. I was eligible to get 50% back for finishing in under a year, and got $50 off my first month so the total post-refund cost for me was **$550**. I believe anyone can finish in under a year if they put in consistent effort.

Upon requesting the 50% refund I was notified that it takes 4-8 weeks to process. After 8 weeks I had yet to receive my refund, so I contacted support and was told that it was on the list of refunds to be paid out soon. I received my full refund the following week. Udacity didn't go out of their way to remind me of the refund when I graduated, and the only [link to the actual refund page](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree/50-back) that I could find was buried in the FAQs section. The refund was a big motivator to finish early and obviously saved me a good amount of money, so it's definitely something to be aware of.

## Difficulty

This will of course vary from person to person, but I'd say in general the program was **easy to moderate** in terms of difficulty. The courses that accompany each project are well done, and I don't recall doing much extra research while working on the core requirements for the projects. Note that I was moderately familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript going in to the program.

## Courses

The courses are **great, but I believe available for free**. The Nanodegree is mostly about the projects.

## Projects

Each project comes with a grading rubric and feedback/code review. The main reason I signed up for the program was to get that feedback. A code reviewer (I believe they're often graduates themselves) goes through your project line-by-line and offers inline feedback where appropriate. The reviewers I got were pleasantly thorough and helpful.

There's a decent degree of flexibility with most of the projects, meaning you're free to use whatever tools or technologies you like as long as you satisfy the rubric.

Udacity has added projects since I graduated, but when I enrolled there were **6 required projects**.

Here they are in order, with links to my completed versions:

- [Portfolio](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects/tree/master/fend-portfolio)
  - Basics.

- [Resume](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects/tree/master/fend-resume)
  - Content from JSON.

- [Frogger Clone](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects/tree/master/fend-frogger)
  - OOP, Canvas

- [Optimization](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects/tree/master/fend-optimization) (of an existing app)
  - Critical rendering path, build tools

- [Neighborhood Map](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects/tree/master/fend-neighborhood-map)
  - Knockout.js framework, APIs

- [Testing](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects/tree/master/fend-feed-reader) (of an existing app)
  - Jasmine

- *Bonus:* [Cat Clicker](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects/tree/master/fend-design-patterns/cat-clicker-v2)
  - MV* design patterns exercise, not graded or reviewed.

When I enrolled there were two passing grades: Meets Specs and Exceeds Specs, but they've since moved to a simple **pass/fail grading system**. Extra credit sort of things are still listed in their own section of the rubric in case you feel like doing them.

I enjoyed the projects and found all but the last one (testing an existing project) to be **pleasantly challenging**. You judge, but I think they'll be helpful while job hunting.

## 1-on-1 Coaching

Coaching is available for (I believe) all projects. I only took advantage of this once. It was a simple instant messaging conversation that easily lasted the scheduled 30 minutes and was acceptably, but not exceptionally, helpful. It did feel a little shallow; I don't think the coach spent more than a few minutes looking through my code prior to the appointment. I may have had a better experience if I went in with a specific problem to solve, but in my case I was just asking for overall impressions which is what I got.

## Career Development Stuff

The program includes a good amount of career development courses (which I assume are free) and projects, plus a sort of exit interview with a career coach.

The career projects were graded and reviewed in the same way as the other projects, with the exception that they're optional.

The ones I completed were:

- Resume

- Cover Letter

- GitHub Profile Review

- LinkedIn Profile Review

These were basically just reviews of existing things for me. There's also a Job Interview project that I'm interested in doing at some point.

About the exit interview:

For me it was a video call with a coach who asked for program feedback and questioned me a little about my goals. There was some miscommunication about where to go to establish the video call, but thankfully I was watching my email when he got in touch with the correct link.

The coach I got was actually a programming coach who apologized and told me that all of the career coaches were busy. He was nice and provided some helpful links, but looking back I would have preferred being rescheduled with a career coach.

## Community

I interacted with my peers exclusively through the program's Slack channel, which was decently active and included a lot of participation from some Udacity employees responsible for the Nanodegree program itself. I had a lot of opportunities to help other students and get additional feedback on my projects. The community was very friendly.

I'm not a fan of traditional forums, but they exist if you prefer them. I don't how active they are though.

## Would I Do It Again?

Yes.

I was switching careers from a non-technical field and I needed the motivation (finishing faster = less money spent) and direction (I get sidetracked or bite off more than I can chew), plus the projects and code reviews were helpful in building confidence and demonstrable experience.

If you don't need motivation, direction, or additional confidence: I recommend free resources instead.
