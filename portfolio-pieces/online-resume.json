  "description": "My online resume for web development. It dynamically creates page content with data retrieved from a JSON object, allowing me to make quick and easy edits and updates. I utilized CSS transitions, a Polymer element, and Google Maps' API to provide additional functionality. I also expanded my workflow options with this project by learning to use Bower and by refining my usage of Gulp. I refactored the project two months after completing it to use a Model-View-Controller design pattern as part of Udactiy's JavaScript Design Patterns course.",
