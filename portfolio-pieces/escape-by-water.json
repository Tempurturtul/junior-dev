  "description": "A clone of the popular frogger game built using a barebones game engine provided by Udacity. I worked heavily with the HTML5 canvas element in this project, and used JavaScript inheritance, the browser's local storage, and the Web Audio API while implementing various features. The game features a persistent scoreboard, menus, canvas-drawn buttons, and mobile support.",
